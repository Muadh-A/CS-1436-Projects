## Folder Structure

### Assignments
Each assignment folder contains a standalone C++ program (`main.cpp`) that meets the requirements of the corresponding assignment.

- `Assignment1-Problem1`
- `Assignment1-Problem2`
- `Assignment2-Problem1`
- `Assignment2-Problem2`
- `Assignment3-Problem1`
- `Assignment3-Problem2`
- `Assignment4`
- `Assignment5`
- `Assignment6`

Assignments typically cover:
- Input/output
- Arithmetic operations
- Decision structures
- Functions
- Pass-by-reference
- Loops
- Program decomposition
